step 2
	1) start at $
	2) go to first . (x.)
	3) move right, read and mark symbol (0=a, 1=b)
		if no symbol to mark, move right past y.
			if no symbol to mark, |x| = |y|. go to step 4
			if symbol to mark, |y| > |x|. go to step 3
	4) move right, past # past second . (y.)
		if no symbol to mark, |x| > |y|. go to step 4
	5) move right, read and mark symbol
	6) move left, past #, stop at marked symbol
	7) repeat 3-6
step 3
	1) copy x to after y
		0 path - read 0, wind past #, write 0 move left
		1 path - read 1, wind past #, write 1 move left
		x path - read x, wind past #, write 0 move left
		y path - read y, wind past #, write 1 move left
	2) go to y., move right and mark symbol
	3) go to x., move right and append 0
	4) repeat 2-3 until move left, stop at marked symbol, move right, # (no more y)
	5) unmark y, append # at end of x
